# Microsoft Recommendations
By: Srinivasan Ramakrishnan and Diego Rangel
## Summary
We got our data from IMDB and the Numbers where we got information such as the genre, studio, run time, gross, and budget. From this data we looked into the foreign versus domestic market, the production budget compared to the worldwide gross, the most used ratings by movies, and the top 5 most popular languages for movies.
## Our Findings
The most profitable movie studio is BV, which is Dinsey, and we can see that foreign movies make a higher gross than domestic movies which is what we should look into. We filtered the data to only include movies that made over $300 million because we wanted only include major movie studios.

We see here that there is a positive correlation between the production budget and the worldwide gross and this shows that Microsoft shoould spend at least $100-$200 million for their first movie to increase the gross of the movie. Microsoft should start at $100-$200 million dollars to test the waters before they spend more on their production budget.

We see here that the worldwide gross is greater in Summer and Winter time (May, June, July, November, and December) and that Microsoft should focus on these months only when they release a movie.

Here we see that the animation genre is the highest grossing genre with a low average runtime of about 90 minutes long. Microsoft should look into animation, but should also look into other genres that can be used alongside animation like comedy and horror for example.

Here we see that the top 5 most popular languages for movies are English, Japanese, Swedish, Polish, and Danish respectively. We measured the popularity of the language by average popularity.

Lastly, here we are measuring the amount of movies that use each rating and we find that the R and PG-13 rating are the most popular of the ratings. We tried the filter the data to also include the language distribution of each rating, but the filtered data only had 36 movies which we felt was not an accurate representation so we did not use it.

## Recommendations
- **Invest in foreign markets:** The foreign market seems to gross more than domestic markets
- **Have a budget of at $100 million:** Start with $100-$200 million and increase the budget based the gross of the first movie
- **Look into animated movies:** Try to make animated movies around 90 minutes and attach it to another genre like horror or comedy for example
- **Make R and PG-13 rated movies**: Do not make G, PG, NR movies and target regions like Japan and the European Union
## Next Steps
- Look at the average production budget of movies to see how much should be spent on the animation genre
- Find what specific rating should be used for the animation or any other genre
